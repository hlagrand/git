That's the blockade comment.  I just put every kind of comment, name, and title you could put onto page A9 (HL Note - it's a different page) .
blockade-comment
part-page-name
part-page-comment
page-name
page-title
page-comment


Follow up note:

Blockade comment is visible whenever there is a blockade.  (depending on how big the block is and how many characters in the blockade name)
Page title appears to be attached to the VJ folio area, which we are throwing out.
Page comments is visible online and in the dummies
Part-page comments can get hidden behind ads or blockades, I don't recommend that one.
Part-page name is kind of invisible. Not recommended either. (we could probably change a setting and have it show up somewhere, but once again, ads would probably layer on top of that)
